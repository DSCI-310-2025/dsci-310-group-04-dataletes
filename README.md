Predicting Weeks on Billboard for Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums
Authors: Ritisha Jhamb, Aarav Mahajan, and Roy Chen

## **About**  

This project builds a regression model using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm to predict the number of weeks an album spends on the Billboard chart (weeks_on_billboard). By leveraging data from Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Albums of All Time” rankings, alongside information such as Spotify popularity, peak Billboard position, and release year, we aim to identify the key factors that contribute to an album’s longevity on the charts.
